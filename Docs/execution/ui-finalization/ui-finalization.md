# Execution Report — UI Finalization — Phase A (UI-F1..UI-F6)

Purpose: make the existing V1 presentation-complete — French primary, Arabic added, RTL-correct,
responsive, visually consistent, browser-verified — without changing business logic, API contracts,
database, migrations, P1–P12 behavior, or product scope.

Authority: `Docs/current/UI-FINALIZATION-MASTER-PLAN.md` (per-item scope/acceptance), `Docs/V1-PHASE-INDEX.md`,
`Docs/00-README.md`. Explorer evidence: `explorer-uifinal.md` + `explorer-uifinal-liveQA.md`
(coordinator copy under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\opencode\`).

Evidence tags: `[VERIFIED]` proven by git/tests/browser/source inspection; `[INFERENCE]` reasoned from
evidence; `[RECOMMENDATION]` advisory; `[UNKNOWN]` not determinable.

## Starting baseline

- Phase start HEAD: `26d023d` — "docs: establish post-P12 UI finalization governance" (docs-only).
  Parent `4b7177d` (P12). [VERIFIED — git log]
- i18n at phase start: en=420, fr=420, ar=109 → AR coverage 26%, 311 keys missing. [VERIFIED]
- Known French leak at phase start: `fr.json` `unit_status.vacant` = English "Vacant". [VERIFIED]
- **Current mission rebaseline**: the phase was re-based for closure on the SOT line —
  local HEAD == `origin/main` == `d249d9e` ("fix: tenant page balance display", parent `5176431`),
  pushed to the GitHub single source of truth before implementation. All closure diffs/commits in
  this report are against `d249d9e`. [VERIFIED — git rev-parse HEAD / origin/main]
- Pre-existing worktree changes (NOT part of this phase; untouched, never staged unless listed):
  inherited modified `src/server/index.ts`, `tests/audit.test.ts` (P12 limits fix: internal
  `AUDIT_DEFAULT_LIMIT`/`AUDIT_MAX_LIMIT` consts + test-local mirrors — Cloudflare Workers forbids
  plain-value exports on the worker entry entry-module; confirmed by diff, the only changes in those
  files), `.opencode/agent/orkestrix-explorer.md`, `.opencode/agent/orkestrix-tester.md`.
  untracked: `.playwright-mcp/`, `Docs.zip`, `Docs/Docs.zip`, `Docs/execution/p5…p8*/`,
  scratch `tc*.txt`/`vt*.txt`. [VERIFIED — git status]

## Review gate

- Inspected `git status --short`, `git log -5`, HEAD/parent above; origin/main parity confirmed before
  implementation and re-confirmed at closure. [VERIFIED]
- Confirmed the working-tree noise set (above) is all untracked or inherited — the Phase A diff is
  `index.html` + `src/client/**` only. [VERIFIED — git diff --name-only / git diff --stat]
- Confirmed `scripts/builder-run.ps1` is the sole Builder entry (pins `opencode-go/kimi-k2.7-code`). [VERIFIED — script read]
- Confirmed runtime: dev servers healthy (5173 vite, 8787 wrangler → 200). [VERIFIED — HTTP probe]

## Explorer findings (read-only, pre-implementation)

Full report with file:line evidence maps to UI-F1..F6; highlights:
- UI-F1: ar.json 109/420 (26%); fr `vacant` leak; status/priority/method/type vocabulary gaps.
- UI-F2: hard-coded "Delete"/"Cancel"/"Close", placeholder examples, raw color labels, wrong
  settings header (`vendors.title`), audit header/empty misuse.
- UI-F3: `--font-sans` had no Arabic-capable face; Inter lacks Arabic glyphs (browser-captured
  fallback); tracking on titles breaks Arabic joining.
- UI-F4: dialog 3-col grids, dashboard KPI/monthly fixed grids, maintenance 6-tab strip,
  PageShell header/actions, SDK rail narrow-width clipping.
- UI-F5: `dir` never set; physical `ml/mr/pl/pr/left/right/text-left/space-x/border-r`;
  non-logical SDK rail (`border-right`, `text-align:left`); unmirrored chevrons/back arrows.
- UI-F6: three badge mechanisms; raw `bg-${c}-500` swatches invisible under Tailwind v4 JIT;
  inconsistent empty/loading states; payment CTA label; settings header label.

## Builder execution

Three rounds, all via the governed wrapper `.\scripts\builder-run.ps1 "<brief>"` (model pinned
`opencode-go/kimi-k2.7-code`). Briefs: `builder-uifinal-brief.md`, `builder-uifinal-fix-brief.md`,
`builder-phaseA-round3-brief.md` (coordinator copies under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\opencode\`).

- Round 1 (UI-F1..F6 full): implemented across 31 tracked files + new `empty-state.tsx`.
  The session ended abnormally (ECONNRESET) while post-verifying — the implementation itself was
  intact and was independently re-verified by the coordinator (typecheck 0, sequential suite green,
  parity 435/435). During the crashed session one transient test failure appeared in
  `tests/audit.test.ts`; in isolation that file passes 28/28, and the full suite is green
  sequentially — the transient was a memory-pressure/parallel-worker artifact, not a code defect. [VERIFIED — reruns]
- Round 2 (closing, UI-F5/F6): unified remaining badges, converted last plain-text empty states to
  the shared `EmptyState`, and made the SDK rail RTL-correct (`padding-inline`, `border-inline-end`,
  `[dir=rtl]` letter-spacing). Exit 0. [VERIFIED]
- Round 3 (final gap-closing + refinements): 10/10 items done — create-mode submit CTAs →
  `common.create` (property/unit/tenant/lease/application/work-order dialogs); payment-dialog footer
  `common.cancel` + `payments.record_payment`; users-tab password label → `users.unchanged`
  (no longer `common.cancel`); tenant lease-history empty state → `EmptyState`; list-page loading
  states wrapped in `Card` (users/audit); property-page chips + `SWATCH_BG` → static `bg-cat-*-solid`
  (settings + property dialog); UI-F4 audit = no responsive gaps; UI-F5 RTL audit = `.stat-label`
  tracking reset + rail logical props; Cairo refined as the primary Arabic face (see UI-F3).
  Bonus fixes in allowed scope: audit header bug (`audit.description`), settings header key,
  vendor-dialog responsive grid, rail logical props, tenant back-arrow `rtl:rotate-180`, badge-tone
  swaps. Typecheck exit 0; sequential suite **15 files / 216 tests green**; parity **436/436/436**.
  [VERIFIED — typecheck/vitest/audit reruns + source]
- None of the three rounds touched `src/server/index.ts`, `tests/audit.test.ts`, node_modules,
  migrations, scripts, .opencode, or the untracked noise. [VERIFIED — git status/diff]

## UI-F1 — Arabic localization

- en=fr=ar = **436 leaf keys** at closure (grew 435→436 mid-phase by `users.unchanged`,
  `audit.description`, `color.*` — all added to the three catalogs in lockstep), identical key
  trees, zero empty values, zero surplus keys. [VERIFIED — parity script]
- ar.json covers navigation, common vocabulary, statuses, priorities, methods, types, categories,
  dashboard, properties, units, tenants, leases, rent, payments, maintenance, work orders, vendors,
  applications, auth, audit, export, errors. Professional Algerian-leaning MSA; `tf()` token
  order preserved.
- French leak fixed: `unit_status.vacant` = "Vacante" (fr). [VERIFIED — parity script output]

## UI-F2 — Hard-coded strings

- `ui/alert-dialog.tsx` + `ui/dialog.tsx`: Delete/Cancel/Close now via `t()` keys; dialog X close
  button and footer spacing logical (`end-4`, `gap-2`). [VERIFIED — source]
- Placeholders ("Leaking kitchen faucet", "Unit 1A", "Oakwood Estate", "123 Main St",
  "Name · phone") and raw color labels translated via `common.placeholder_*` / `color.*` keys
  (added to all three catalogs in lockstep). [VERIFIED — source + parity]
- Settings header now `settings.title` (was `vendors.title`). [VERIFIED]
- Remaining intentional non-translations untouched: `DZD` currency placeholder, audit diff
  technical values, wilaya data. [VERIFIED — scanner exemptions]

## UI-F3 — Arabic typography (Cairo refined)

- `--font-sans` = `"Inter", "Cairo", "Noto Sans Arabic", -apple-system, …`; Google Fonts link
  extended with `family=Cairo:wght@400;500;600;700` (index.html:11, styles.css:193).
  [VERIFIED — source]
- **Refinement**: the master plan proposed "Noto Sans Arabic" as the Arabic face; on browser
  evidence Cairo was selected as the primary Arabic UI font (Cairo first among Arabic-capable faces,
  Noto Sans Arabic retained as second fallback; FR/EN typography unchanged — Inter first). [VERIFIED — styles.css]
- Browser proof that Cairo actually renders Arabic (not the fallback):
  - On an Arabic page, `document.fonts.check('32px "Cairo"', "العربية")` = **true** (Arabic subset
    loaded); the AR page's loaded `Cairo 400/500/600` faces include the Arabic subset. [VERIFIED — playwright evaluate]
  - Metric comparison: "لوحة التحكم" measures **160 px** under `"Cairo"` vs **119 px** under
    `"Noto Sans Arabic"` — different metric tables prove Cairo is the actual rendering engine for
    Arabic text. [VERIFIED — playwright evaluate]
  - Note: `document.fonts.check('16px "Cairo"')` (no text → space glyph) returns false on pages
    where only the Arabic subset is loaded (space lives in the Latin subset) — an artifact of the
    check API, not a font defect; the Arabic-subset check with Arabic text is the authoritative test.
- `[lang=ar]`/`[dir=rtl]` rules: body `line-height: 1.65`; zero letter-spacing on tracking classes
  and rail items, including the `.stat-label` reset (keeps Arabic letter-joining). [VERIFIED — styles.css]
- Latin/French typography untouched (Inter first in stack; rules keyed to ar/rtl only).

## UI-F4 — Responsive behavior

- Dialog forms: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` (3-column rows → `lg:grid-cols-3`) across
  property/lease/tenant/unit/work-order/application/payment/charge-edit/vendor dialogs. [VERIFIED — source]
- Dashboard KPI/monthly trio → `grid-cols-1 … sm:grid-cols-3` (monthly trio collapses
  `sm:grid-cols-3`); property cards `md/lg` responsive. [VERIFIED]
- Maintenance filter `TabsList` → `flex-wrap h-auto`. [VERIFIED]
- PageShell header → `flex-wrap`, actions wrap, `px-4 md:px-6`, meta truncates. [VERIFIED]
- No page-level horizontal overflow at 375–1440px in browser QA (66 runs, see below). [VERIFIED — Playwright]

## UI-F5 — RTL

- `use-app-state.ts` sets `document.documentElement.dir` = `"rtl"` for ar else `"ltr"`, alongside
  `lang` from locale. [VERIFIED — source ~99-100]
- Physical LTR classes converted to logical (ms/me/ps/pe/start/end/text-start/text-end), including
  money/due columns, search icons (`start-3`/`ps-9`), dialog close (`end-4`), destructive footer
  buttons (`sm:me-auto`), rail `text-align:start`/`padding-inline`/`border-inline-end` +
  `[dir=rtl]` letter-spacing. [VERIFIED — source scan; sole remaining physical class is
  `error-banner.tsx` `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`, a centering idiom that centers in both directions]
- Directional icons mirrored with `rtl:rotate-180` (back arrows on property/tenant pages, month
  stepper chevrons on rent page). [VERIFIED — source]
- Numbers/dates/financial values remain readable; `tabular-nums` retained. [VERIFIED — QA]
- Browser assertion: rail sits at the left edge on ALL 33 FR runs and at the right edge
  (`railRect.right ≈ clientWidth`) on ALL 33 AR runs. [VERIFIED — Playwright per-run rail checks]

## UI-F6 — Visual consistency (no redesign)

- Badges unified on `badge-tone` tints: leases, applications, users (role), tenant-page lease
  status, settings vendor categories, property-page priority/WO-status (local tone maps). [VERIFIED]
- CTA: payment dialog (`-edit`) buttons use `common.save` / `common.cancel` / submit
  `payments.record_payment`; destructive feet use `common.delete`; create-mode submits use
  `common.create`. [VERIFIED]
- Audit tab: `audit.empty` renders only when the list is empty; permanent header uses
  `audit.description`. [VERIFIED]
- Dynamic `bg-${c}-500` swatches → static `SWATCH_BG` lookup maps + `color.*` labels (settings +
  property dialog), rendered `bg-cat-*-solid`. [VERIFIED — source]
- Empty states unified on shared `src/client/components/empty-state.tsx` (units, vendors, users,
  audit, work orders, leases, tenants, tenancy history, rent). [VERIFIED]
- Loading states consistent `Card` blocks (`Card p-8 text-center`), including users/audit list tabs
  and — after reviewer remediation — the dashboard/property/tenant detail pages (were bare centered
  text divs; wrapped in `Card` at closure). [VERIFIED — source]
- Detail-page back headers (property/tenant) align with PageShell title typography. [VERIFIED]

## Tests / typecheck

- `pnpm typecheck` → **exit 0** (16 GB heap flag disabled; the flag triggers exit-134 V8 aborts on
  this 7.8 GB machine — environmental). [VERIFIED — fresh rerun at closure]
- `pnpm vitest run --no-file-parallelism` → **15 files / 216 tests green, exit 0** (fresh rerun at
  closure on the final tree). [VERIFIED]
- `tests/audit.test.ts` in isolation → 28/28. [VERIFIED]
- Independent tester subagent re-verified sequentially: 15 files passed, exit 0, plus plain
  `pnpm test` passed. [VERIFIED — tester report]
- Environment note `[INFERENCE]`: parallel worker runs on this 7.8 GB machine can crash a vitest
  worker (the earlier "1 file incomplete / 215+1" sighting) — rerun sequentially before any FAIL
  conclusion; no code defect involved.

## Browser QA

Harness desktop browser is disconnected in this mission, so QA used the app's own tooling:
playwright-core (npx cache) + installed chromium-1234, headless, driven by Node scripts
(`qa-phaseA.mjs`, probes). Dev-DB QA credentials: `owner@example.com` / `securepass123` (password
reset via `wrangler d1 execute` — a **QA-environment-only** change to local DB data, not code).

- Driver v3 forces the locale per pass through `PUT /api/settings` (auth-verified owner session,
  confirmed via `/api/auth/session`), reload, then waits for the exact `lang`/`dir` before sweeping.
  This fixed the v1/v2 silent flaw (the dev DB's locale was `ar` left over from earlier rounds, so
  post-login pages rendered Arabic even during the "FR" pass — proven by byte-identical FR/AR
  screenshots and the rail-side metric). [VERIFIED]
- Sweep: languages FR (fr-DZ) and AR × widths 375/768/1440 × 10 routes + login page (375, logged
  out) + settings Users/Audit tabs + AR property dialog = **66 measured runs + dialog/login**.
  Per run: `lang`, `dir`, overflow (`scrollW > clientW`), rail side vs `dir`, Arabic-character
  presence in visible text, console/page errors.
- Result: **0 overflows, 0 JS errors, FR 33/33 lang=fr-DZ dir=ltr rail-left no-Arabic-text,
  AR 33/33 lang=ar dir=rtl rail-right Arabic-text-present**. Summary JSON:
  `.playwright-mcp/phaseA3/qa-summary.json` (+ 70 screenshots incl. probe evidence). [VERIFIED]
- Only console noise: 404 "Failed to load resource" on `/tenants/1` in both languages — expected
  (dev seed contains no tenant rows); the route renders its not-found state gracefully, no JS
  error. [VERIFIED]
- Font evidence (probes `probe-fonts.mjs`, `probe-ar-font.mjs`): Google Fonts css2 200; Cairo
  faces 400–700 loaded; Arabic subset verified via `fonts.check` and the 160px-vs-119px metric
  (see UI-F3). [VERIFIED]
- Locale restored to `fr-DZ` post-QA, verified via `SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key='locale'`.
  [VERIFIED]

## Tester verdict

Independent tester subagent (read-only test/typecheck runs): sequential vitest **15 files / 15
passed, exit 0**; plain `pnpm test` passed; typecheck exit 0. **PASS** [VERIFIED]

## Reviewer verdict

Read-only reviewer subagent, four review rounds on this tree (each round's findings remediated
before the next):
- R1 → FAIL: read-only agent could not execute git/test/i18n commands (`[UNKNOWN]`), the execution
  record was stale (pre-Cairo, pending sections), and three detail-page loading states
  (dashboard/property/tenant) were bare text divs instead of `Card`.
  Remediation: loading states Card-wrapped (see UI-F6); record rewritten; typecheck / 216-test
  suite / parity / git-scope re-run by the coordinator on the final tree (all green).
- R2 → FAIL (documentation): suggested `error-banner.tsx` was modified-but-unlisted and flagged the
  "pending" markers. Fact-check: error-banner has no diff (unmodified); the "28th component" was
  the already-listed `ui/badge.tsx` deletion. Remediation: explicit "NOT modified" line for
  error-banner + full count breakdown; "Final git verification" now explicitly a post-commit
  fill-in by design.
- R3 → FAIL (wording): scope arithmetic "(28 modified, 1 deleted…) " double-counted.
  Remediation: exact accounting (29 component paths = 27 M + 1 D + 1 new; +7 other tracked = 36
  changed paths in the closure commit).
- R4 → **PASS — closure-ready**: no CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM; arithmetic self-consistent and matches
  ground truth; error-banner + post-commit wording corrections accurate; one LOW documentation nit
  (recorded and fixed below). [VERIFIED — reviewer reports]
- Final verdict: **PASS**.

## Changed-file scope

UI-finalization diff — all under `src/client/` plus `index.html`:
- new: `src/client/components/empty-state.tsx`
- modified: `index.html`; `src/client/app.tsx`; `src/client/hooks/use-app-state.ts`;
  `src/client/styles.css`; `src/client/i18n/{en,fr,ar}.json`;
  `components/{applications/application-dialog.tsx, applications/applications-page.tsx,
  dashboard/dashboard-page.tsx, leases/lease-dialog.tsx, leases/leases-page.tsx,
  maintenance/maintenance-page.tsx, maintenance/work-order-dialog.tsx, page-shell.tsx,
  properties/properties-list.tsx, properties/property-dialog.tsx, properties/property-page.tsx,
  properties/unit-dialog.tsx, rent/charge-edit-dialog.tsx, rent/payment-dialog.tsx,
  rent/rent-page.tsx, settings/audit-tab.tsx, settings/settings-page.tsx,
  settings/users-tab.tsx, tenants/tenant-dialog.tsx, tenants/tenant-page.tsx,
  tenants/tenants-list.tsx, ui/alert-dialog.tsx, ui/dialog.tsx, ui/dropdown-menu.tsx,
  ui/scroll-area.tsx, ui/select.tsx, ui/table.tsx}` — exact accounting for the closure commit:
  29 component paths = 27 modified + 1 deleted (`ui/badge.tsx`) + 1 new (`empty-state.tsx`),
  plus 7 other tracked files (`index.html`, `app.tsx`, `hooks/use-app-state.ts`, `styles.css`,
  `i18n/{en,fr,ar}.json`) = **36 changed paths** in the closure commit, plus this execution record.
  (35 Phase A tracked delta entries match `git diff --stat`; the +2 entries there are the inherited
  `src/server/index.ts` and `tests/audit.test.ts`, excluded from the commit.) [VERIFIED — git status/diff --stat]
- NOT modified (explicitly confirmed): `src/client/components/error-banner.tsx` has no diff
  (`git status`/`git diff` empty for it); its mention in "Known deviations" is only the accepted
  remaining physical-centering idiom, not a change. [VERIFIED — git status/diff on that path]
- Untouched: `migrations/**`, `package.json`, `wrangler.toml`, `scripts/**`, `.opencode/**`,
  `node_modules/**`; `src/server/index.ts` + `tests/audit.test.ts` carry only the inherited
  P12-limits fix (never staged in the closure commit). [VERIFIED]
- Deliberate consolidation `[RECOMMENDATION]`: converting empty-state blocks to `EmptyState`
  dropped the assistant descriptions and the redundant inline create-CTA on leases/tenants; the
  primary create affordance remains in each page header ("New" actions), and the description keys
  (`leases.empty_desc`, `tenants.empty_desc`, etc.) remain in the catalogs for reuse. No functional
  regression. [VERIFIED — header actions]

## Known deviations

- **Cairo over Noto Sans Arabic**: intentional UI-F3 refinement, documented above; FR/EN
  typography unchanged; Noto Sans Arabic retained as second Arabic-capable fallback. [VERIFIED]
- i18n count 436 (vs 435 pre-Round-3): grew by `users.unchanged`, `audit.description`, `color.*`
  — all added to en/fr/ar in lockstep; parity script authoritative. [VERIFIED — parity]
- `error-banner.tsx` retains physical centering (`left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`) — centers in both
  directions; acceptable. It is not part of the Phase A diff (unmodified; see Changed-file scope).
- Dev-DB password reset (owner → `securepass123`) is a QA-environment-only local-DB mutation;
  no code/db-schema change; locale restored to `fr-DZ`.
- `Docs/00-README.md` / `V1-PHASE-INDEX.md` updates deferred (documented out of scope this pass).
- `[UNKNOWN]` none outstanding.

## Final commit

- Exactly one commit on top of `d249d9e`:
  `feat: finalize bilingual responsive RTL UI`
- Staged: `index.html`, `src/client/**` (incl. `empty-state.tsx`), this execution record.
- Never staged: `src/server/index.ts`, `tests/audit.test.ts`, `Docs.zip`, `Docs/Docs.zip`,
  `Docs/execution/P5..P8/`, tc/vt scratch, `.playwright-mcp/`.
- Hash recorded post-commit (append below).

## Final git verification

(post-commit fill-in, by design — matches the established P-phase record pattern: the commit hash
and the post-commit HEAD/status/log/SOT-parity checks are recorded into this section immediately
after the single closure commit is created, since the hash cannot exist before the commit)
